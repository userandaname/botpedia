It runs on a High-Performance Server with the following specifications:","128 CPU cores, fully dedicated to image rendering.","700GB of RAM, optimized for handling complex tasks.","32TB SSD storage, designed for fast and efficient performance.","These specifications ensure that CivilityAI can handle high user demands while maintaining quick response times."]},{"l":"Customization Features","p":["CivilityAI offers users a variety of ways to customize their images.

However, Skycodee has repeatedly affirmed their commitment to maintaining and developing the bot. As of December 2024, the bot continues to operate efficiently, with no plans for discontinuation."]},{"l":"Summary","p":["CivilityAI is classified on Botpedia as online under the development of Skycodee.
